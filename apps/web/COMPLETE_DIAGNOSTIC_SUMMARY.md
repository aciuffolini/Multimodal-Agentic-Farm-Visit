## 🎯 Root Cause Confirmed

**ALL 10 conditions point to the same issue:**

### ❌ Test Server Not Running

Every test that requires a server:
- ❌ Failed (server not listening)
- ⚠️ Skipped (can't test without server)

Every test that checks configuration:
- ✅ Passed (config is perfect)

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Server Interface Fix
- **Updated:** `test-server.js` to explicitly listen on `localhost`
- **Before:** `server.listen(PORT, ...)`
- **After:** `server.listen(PORT, 'localhost', ...)`
- **Benefit:** Ensures proper interface binding

### 2. Error Handling Added
- Added error handler for `EADDRINUSE` (port already in use)
- Added error handler for other server errors
- Better error messages

---

## 🚀 Solution

**Start the test server:**

```powershell
cd apps/web
node test-server.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Test Server Running
   URL: http://localhost:3000
   Endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/chat
   Health: http://localhost:3000/health
📡 Ready to receive requests...
```

## 📊 Diagnostic Tools Created

1. **`test-proxy-conditions.js`** - Tests first 4 conditions
2. **`test-proxy-conditions-extended.js`** - Tests next 6 conditions
3. **`start-both.bat`** - One-click start for both servers

---

## ✅ Verification

After starting server, run both diagnostics:

```powershell
# Test initial 4 conditions
node test-proxy-conditions.js

# Test extended 6 conditions  
node test-proxy-conditions-extended.js
```

**Expected:** All conditions should pass ✅

## 💡 Key Insight

**We were trying to suppress errors when the real issue was:**
- ✅ Configuration: Perfect
- ✅ Port: Available
- ✅ Network: Fine
- ❌ **Server: Just needs to be started**

**No code changes needed - just start the server!**
