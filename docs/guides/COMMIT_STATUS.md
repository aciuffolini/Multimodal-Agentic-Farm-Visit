## About the Warnings

### CRLF/LF Warnings
```
warning: in the working copy of 'QUICK_FIX_PLAN.md', CRLF will be replaced by LF
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ **Normal and safe** - Git is just normalizing line endings
- ✅ **Not an error** - Commit still succeeds
- ✅ **Automatic** - Git handles this automatically
- ✅ **Standard practice** - Prevents cross-platform issues

**Why it happens:**
- Windows uses CRLF (`\r\n`)
- Linux/Mac use LF (`\n`)
- Git normalizes to LF in repository
- This is configured in `.gitattributes`

**Action needed:** None - this is automatic and safe

## Other Modified Files

You see many "modified" files in `git status`:
- These are **different files** (documentation, etc.)
- They were **not included** in this commit
- This is **intentional** - we only committed the solution discussion files
- They remain as **working directory changes**

**This is normal and expected!**
