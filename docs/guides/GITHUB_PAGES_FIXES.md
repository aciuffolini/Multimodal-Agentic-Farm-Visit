# 🔧 GitHub Pages Workflow - 5 Most Probable Failure Causes & Fixes

## Analysis of Common GitHub Pages Deployment Failures

This document addresses the **5 most probable causes** of GitHub Pages deployment failures and their solutions.

---

## ✅ Fix #1: Monorepo Workspace Build Issue

### Problem
- Monorepo structure requires proper workspace installation
- Dependencies might not resolve correctly between `packages/shared` and `apps/web`
- Build order matters: shared package must be built before web app

### Solution Applied
```yaml
- Install all dependencies at root using npm workspaces
- Explicitly build shared package first with verification
- Check shared package exists before building web app
```

### Changes
- Use `npm install --workspaces` to handle monorepo properly
- Build `packages/shared` first and verify output
- Add fallback check in web app build to rebuild shared if missing

---

## ✅ Fix #2: NPM Install/Cache Issues

### Problem
- `npm ci` requires `package-lock.json` and exact versions
- Dependency conflicts with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Node version mismatch (was using Node 18, upgraded to 20)

### Solution Applied
```yaml
- Upgraded to Node 20 (more stable, better npm support)
- Use npm workspaces for proper dependency resolution
- Fallback to workspace install if root install fails
```

### Changes
- Changed Node version from `18` to `20`
- Use `npm install --workspaces --legacy-peer-deps` with fallback
- Better error handling for installation failures

---

## ✅ Fix #3: TypeScript Build Errors

### Problem
- Build script runs `tsc -b && vite build` - if TypeScript fails, build fails
- No type checking before build
- TypeScript errors not clearly displayed

### Solution Applied
```yaml
- Run type-check before build (with continue-on-error)
- Capture and display TypeScript errors clearly
- Show specific error lines and file locations
```

### Changes
- Added `npm run type-check` step before build
- Capture TypeScript errors in log file
- Display last 50 lines of type errors on failure
- Show TypeScript version and tsconfig.json for debugging

---

## ✅ Fix #4: GitHub Pages Environment Setup

### Problem
- Deploy job might fail if GitHub Pages not configured in repository
- No clear error message when Pages isn't enabled
- Environment variable not properly set

### Solution Applied
```yaml
- Deploy job with continue-on-error for graceful handling
- Check deployment status and provide helpful error message
- Direct link to repository settings page
```

### Changes
- Added `continue-on-error: true` to deploy step
- Post-deployment status check with helpful error message
- Directs user to repository settings if deployment fails

---

## ✅ Fix #5: Build Output Verification

### Problem
- Build might succeed but output might be missing or incorrect
- Base path might not be set correctly in build output
- No verification of actual build artifacts

### Solution Applied
```yaml
- Verify dist directory exists
- Verify index.html exists
- Check base path is correctly set in HTML
- Show build output size and key files
```

### Changes
- Multiple verification steps for build output
- Check if base path (`/Agentic-Farm-Visit/`) is in HTML
- Display build size and key files for verification
- Better error messages if verification fails

---

## 📋 Complete Fix Summary

### Workflow Structure
1. **Install all dependencies** (root + workspaces)
2. **Build shared package** (with verification)
3. **Build web app** (with type check + verification)
4. **Upload artifact** (with path verification)
5. **Deploy** (with status check)

### Key Improvements
- ✅ Node 20 (more stable)
- ✅ Proper workspace handling
- ✅ TypeScript error detection
- ✅ Build output verification
- ✅ Base path validation
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging
- ✅ Helpful error messages with links

### Error Diagnostics
Each step now includes:
- Detailed error logs (last 50-100 lines)
- Specific error type detection (TS, Vite, npm)
- Verification of prerequisites
- Helpful error messages with solutions

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Monitor the workflow run** - Check Actions tab for detailed logs
2. **If it still fails** - The error logs will now show exactly what failed
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** (if not already):
   - Go to: `https://github.com/aciuffolini/Agentic-Farm-Visit/settings/pages`
   - Set Source to: **GitHub Actions**
   - Click Save

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### If Build Fails

**Check the error logs for:**
1. TypeScript errors → Check `typecheck.log` output
2. Vite errors → Check `build.log` output
3. Missing dependencies → Check install logs
4. Shared package issues → Check shared package build logs

### If Deploy Fails

**Common causes:**
1. GitHub Pages not enabled → Check repository settings
2. Permission issues → Check workflow permissions
3. Artifact not uploaded → Check upload step logs

### If Pages Not Accessible

**After successful deployment:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for propagation
2. Check URL: `https://aciuffolini.github.io/Agentic-Farm-Visit/`
3. Verify base path is correct in browser DevTools
