# 🔧 FINAL SOLUTION - Make v1.0.8-fix Downloadable

## The Problem

- ✅ Code is committed (v1.0.8-fix)
- ✅ Tag exists (v1.0.8-fix)
- ❌ GitHub Release doesn't exist or isn't marked as "latest"
- ❌ APK file isn't uploaded to release
- ❌ Download button points to `/releases/latest` which still shows v1.0.5

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Automatic - RECOMMENDED)

The workflow automatically builds and releases when you push a tag. To trigger it:

1. **Go to GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/aciuffolini/Agentic-Farm-Visit/actions
2. **Click "Build Android APK" workflow**
3. **Click "Run workflow"** (dropdown button)
4. **Select branch**: `main`
5. **Click "Run workflow"**
6. **Wait for build to complete** (takes 5-10 minutes)
7. **Check Releases**: https://github.com/aciuffolini/Agentic-Farm-Visit/releases
8. The workflow will:
   - Build the APK
   - Create a release for v1.0.8-fix
   - Upload the APK automatically
   - Mark it as latest

**OR** re-trigger by re-pushing the tag:
```bash
git tag -d v1.0.8-fix  # Delete local tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.8-fix  # Delete remote tag
git tag v1.0.8-fix  # Recreate tag
git push origin v1.0.8-fix  # Push tag (triggers workflow)
```

### Option 2: Manual Release (If workflow fails)

1. **Build APK locally** (see BUILD_AND_UPLOAD_APK.md)
2. **Go to**: https://github.com/aciuffolini/Agentic-Farm-Visit/releases
3. **Click "Draft a new release"**
4. **Select tag**: `v1.0.8-fix`
5. **Title**: `Farm Visit App v1.0.8-fix`
6. **Check "Set as the latest release"** ✅ (CRITICAL!)
7. **Upload APK file** in "Attach binaries"
8. **Name it**: `app-debug.apk` (exact name)
9. **Click "Publish release"**

## Why This Will Work

The download button uses `/releases/latest/download/app-debug.apk`:
- `/releases/latest` = Most recently **published** release (not latest tag)
- When v1.0.8-fix is published as a release → it becomes "latest"
- When APK is named `app-debug.apk` → download link works
- Button will automatically download v1.0.8-fix

## Verification

After publishing:
1. Visit: https://github.com/aciuffolini/Agentic-Farm-Visit/releases/latest
2. Should show: **v1.0.8-fix** (not v1.0.5)
3. Should have: **app-debug.apk** in Assets
4. Click download button → Downloads v1.0.8-fix ✅

## Quick Action

**EASIEST**: Use GitHub Actions workflow
1. Go to: https://github.com/aciuffolini/Agentic-Farm-Visit/actions/workflows/build-apk.yml
2. Click "Run workflow" → Run
3. Wait for completion
4. Done! ✅
