# 🔍 Comprehensive Deployment Failure Diagnosis

## Executive Summary

**Status**: Systematic GitHub Pages deployment failures  
**Root Causes Identified**: 5 critical issues  
**Fix Strategy**: Complete workflow rewrite with proper monorepo handling

---

## 1. Build Failures Analysis

### Issue #1: Monorepo Workspace Dependency Resolution ❌

**Problem**:
- Current workflow installs dependencies in `apps/web` directory
- `@farm-visit/shared: workspace:*` dependency cannot resolve
- npm workspaces require installation at **root level** to create symlinks

**Evidence**:
```yaml
# Current (WRONG):
- name: Install and build
  working-directory: apps/web
  run: |
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps  # ❌ Can't resolve workspace:*
```

**Impact**: Build fails with `Cannot find module '@farm-visit/shared'`

---

### Issue #2: Incorrect Build Order ⚠️

**Problem**:
- Shared package must be built **before** web app
- Current workflow builds shared in middle of install step
- No verification that shared build succeeded

**Evidence**:
```yaml
# Current (FRAGILE):
cd ../../packages/shared && npm install && npm run build && cd ../../apps/web
npm run build  # ❌ No check if shared build succeeded
```

**Impact**: Race condition, missing type definitions

---

### Issue #3: Missing Workspace Installation at Root ❌

**Problem**:
- Root `package.json` defines workspaces but workflow never installs at root
- Workspace symlinks are never created
- Each package installs independently (not as workspace)

**Evidence**:
- Root has `workspaces: ["apps/*", "packages/*"]`
- Workflow never runs `npm install` at root
- No workspace linking happens

**Impact**: Workspace dependencies don't resolve

---

### Issue #4: Vite Alias vs Workspace Dependency Conflict ⚠️

**Problem**:
- `vite.config.ts` uses alias: `'@farm-visit/shared': path.resolve(__dirname, '../../packages/shared/src')`
- This points to **source** TypeScript files
- But `package.json` declares workspace dependency expecting **built** files
- Two different resolution strategies conflict

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
alias: {
  '@farm-visit/shared': path.resolve(__dirname, '../../packages/shared/src'),
}
```

```json
// apps/web/package.json
"dependencies": {
  "@farm-visit/shared": "workspace:*"  // Expects dist/
}
```

**Impact**: Works in dev (Vite compiles TS), but build might fail if types are needed

---

### Issue #5: No Error Handling or Verification ❌

**Problem**:
- No checks if build artifacts exist
- No verification of dist/ directory
- Silent failures possible

**Impact**: Deployment fails without clear error messages

---

## 2. Runtime Errors Analysis

### Environment Variables ✅

**Status**: Correctly configured
- `VITE_BASE_PATH: /Agentic-Farm-Visit/` set in workflow
- Vite config reads from `process.env.VITE_BASE_PATH`
- Default fallback to `/Agentic-Farm-Visit/` for production

**No issues found**

---

### Port Conflicts ✅

**Status**: Not applicable for static build
- GitHub Pages serves static files
- No server ports needed
- Vite proxy config only used in dev mode

**No issues found**

---

## 3. Configuration Problems

### Path Issues ⚠️

**Problem**: 
- Relative paths in workflow (`cd ../../packages/shared`)
- Working directory changes can break path resolution
- No absolute path verification

**Fix**: Use explicit paths or stay in root

---

### Permissions ✅

**Status**: Correctly configured
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

**No issues found**

---

## 4. Resource Limitations

### Memory/CPU ✅

**Status**: Standard GitHub Actions runner sufficient
- Build is lightweight (React + Vite)
- No heavy processing
- No issues expected

---

### Storage ✅

**Status**: Artifact size reasonable
- Static build typically < 10MB
- Well within GitHub limits

---

## 5. Dependency Version Conflicts

### Analysis ✅

**Status**: No conflicts detected
- All packages use compatible versions
- `--legacy-peer-deps` flag handles peer dependency issues
- React 19.1.1 compatible with Vite 7.1.7

**No issues found**

---

## 6. File Path Issues

### Relative vs Absolute ⚠️

**Problem**:
- Workflow uses `cd` commands with relative paths
- `working-directory` changes context
- Path resolution can break

**Fix**: Use root-level commands with workspace flags

---

## 7. Missing Build Artifacts

### Verification ❌

**Problem**:
- No check if `apps/web/dist` exists after build
- No verification of `packages/shared/dist` before web build
- Silent failures possible

**Fix**: Add explicit verification steps

---

## 8. CORS and Security Headers ✅

**Status**: Not applicable for static site
- GitHub Pages handles CORS
- No API calls from deployed site (all client-side)

**No issues found**

---

## 9. SSL/TLS Certificate ✅

**Status**: GitHub Pages provides HTTPS automatically

**No issues found**

---

## 10. Agentic AI Application Specific Checks

### API Key Configuration ✅

**Status**: Client-side only
- API keys stored in `localStorage`
- No server-side API key needed for build
- Build doesn't require API access

**No issues found**

---

### Model Endpoints ✅

**Status**: Runtime only
- LLM calls happen at runtime
- Build doesn't need model access

**No issues found**

---

## Root Cause Summary

### Primary Issues (Must Fix):

1. **❌ Workspace installation at wrong level** - Install at root, not in apps/web
2. **❌ Missing workspace linking** - npm workspaces need root install
3. **⚠️ Build order not guaranteed** - Need explicit verification steps
4. **⚠️ No artifact verification** - Silent failures possible

### Secondary Issues (Should Fix):

5. **⚠️ Path resolution fragility** - Use workspace commands instead of cd
6. **⚠️ Error handling** - Add verification and clear error messages

---

## Solution Strategy

### Fix #1: Install at Root (Critical)
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Fix #2: Build Shared First (Critical)
```yaml
- name: Build shared package
  run: npm run build:shared
```

### Fix #3: Verify Shared Build (Critical)
```yaml
- name: Verify shared build
  run: |
    [ -d "packages/shared/dist" ] || exit 1
    [ -f "packages/shared/dist/index.js" ] || exit 1
```

### Fix #4: Build Web App (Critical)
```yaml
- name: Build web app
  working-directory: apps/web
  env:
    VITE_BASE_PATH: /Agentic-Farm-Visit/
  run: npm run build
```

### Fix #5: Verify Web Build (Critical)
```yaml
- name: Verify web build
  run: |
    [ -d "apps/web/dist" ] || exit 1
    [ -f "apps/web/dist/index.html" ] || exit 1
```

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Local Test**:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run build:shared
   npm run build:web
   ls apps/web/dist/
   ```

2. **CI Test**:
   - Push to branch
   - Watch workflow logs
   - Verify each step succeeds
   - Check artifact upload

3. **Deployment Test**:
   - Verify GitHub Pages site loads
   - Check base path routing
   - Test PWA manifest

---

## Expected Outcome

After fixes:
- ✅ Dependencies install correctly
- ✅ Shared package builds first
- ✅ Web app builds successfully
- ✅ Artifacts verified
- ✅ Deployment succeeds
- ✅ Site accessible at `https://aciuffolini.github.io/Agentic-Farm-Visit/`
