# 🔍 GitHub Pages Deployment - Failure Analysis

## Saga of Failures

### Attempt 1: Added VITE_BASE_PATH
- **Issue**: Build failing, assumed it was base path
- **Fix**: Added environment variable
- **Result**: ❌ Still failed

### Attempt 2: Restructured workflow (separate jobs)
- **Issue**: Complex workflow structure
- **Fix**: Split into build/deploy jobs
- **Result**: ❌ Still failed

### Attempt 3: Simplified workflow
- **Issue**: Over-complicated error handling
- **Fix**: Minimal workflow approach
- **Result**: ❌ Still failed

### Attempt 4: Workspace package resolution
- **Issue**: Module resolution for @farm-visit/shared
- **Fix**: Added workspace dependency + Vite alias
- **Result**: ❌ Still failed

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Real Problem

The build script uses `tsc -b` which requires **TypeScript Project References** to be properly configured:

1. **Build script**: `"build": "tsc -b && vite build"`
   - `tsc -b` builds TypeScript project references
   - Requires `composite: true` in referenced packages
   - Requires references in tsconfig.json

2. **Current state**:
   - ✅ Shared package builds separately (has `outDir` and emits files)
   - ❌ Shared package tsconfig.json missing `composite: true`
   - ❌ Web app tsconfig.json doesn't reference shared package
   - ⚠️ Web app has `noEmit: true` (doesn't emit, just type checks)

3. **The issue**:
   - When `tsc -b` runs, it tries to build project references
   - Shared package isn't set up as a reference
   - TypeScript can't resolve `@farm-visit/shared` types during build
   - Build fails before Vite even runs

## Most Probable Issue

**TypeScript Project References not configured** → `tsc -b` fails → Build stops

## Solution Strategy

Two approaches:

### Option A: Fix TypeScript Project References (Recommended)
- Add `composite: true` to shared package tsconfig
- Add reference to shared package in web app tsconfig
- Ensure build order is correct

### Option B: Simplify Build (Faster)
- Change build script to skip `tsc -b`
- Use `tsc --noEmit` for type checking (optional)
- Let Vite handle all bundling (it already does)
- Rely on workspace linking for module resolution

## Recommended Fix: Option B (Simpler, More Reliable)

Vite already handles:
- TypeScript compilation
- Module resolution
- Bundling

The `tsc -b` step is redundant and causes issues. We should:
1. Remove `tsc -b` from build script
2. Use Vite's built-in TypeScript handling
3. Keep workspace dependency for proper linking
4. Keep Vite alias as fallback
