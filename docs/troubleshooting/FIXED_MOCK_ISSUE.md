# ✅ FIXED: Mock Response Repeating Issue

## 🐛 Problem

**What was happening:**
- Gemini Nano mock mode was enabled on web (localhost)
- LLMProvider tried Gemini Nano first
- Mock returned the same response repeatedly
- Never fell through to Cloud API

**You saw:**
- Same message repeating: "I can help you with field visit information..."
- Never got real responses from Cloud API

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**1. Updated LLMProvider:**
- Now skips Gemini Nano on web (only uses on native Android)
- Goes straight to Cloud API on web browsers

**2. Updated GeminiNanoNative.web.ts:**
- Always returns `available: false` on web
- Forces fallback to Cloud API

---

## 🧪 Test Now

**1. Refresh browser:**
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (hard refresh)
- Or close and reopen: http://localhost:5179/

**2. Test chat:**
- Open chat drawer
- Send message: "Hello, tell me about corn"
- **Should now get real response from Cloud API!**

**3. Check console:**
- Should see: `[LLMProvider] Skipping Gemini Nano on web`
- Should see: `[LLMProvider] Using Cloud API (Priority 3 - Online Fallback)`
- Should see: `[API] Using user-provided API key`

## ✅ Expected Behavior Now

**Before (broken):**
- ❌ Mock Gemini Nano response (same every time)
- ❌ Never reached Cloud API

**After (fixed):**
- ✅ Skips Gemini Nano on web
- ✅ Uses Cloud API with your API key
- ✅ Real responses from OpenAI

---

## 🎯 Quick Test

**Send different messages:**
1. "Hello" → Should get different response
2. "Tell me about wheat" → Should get relevant response
3. "What pests affect corn?" → Should get specific answer

**If you get DIFFERENT responses each time:** ✅ It's working!

**If you still get the same mock response:** 
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check console for `[LLMProvider] Using Cloud API`

## 📋 Summary

- ✅ Fixed: Gemini Nano mock disabled on web
- ✅ Fixed: LLMProvider skips Gemini Nano on web
- ✅ Now: Uses Cloud API with real responses
- ✅ Test: Refresh and try chat again

**Refresh browser and test chat - should work now!**
